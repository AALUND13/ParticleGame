# Particle Game

Welcome to the Particle Game, an interactive simulation where you can experiment with different particle behaviors. Here's how to navigate and interact with the game:

## Controls:

- **Scroll Wheel:** Adjust the brush size to control the area of effect.

- **Keybinds (0-3):** Select a particle to spawn. Each keybind corresponds to a specific particle type.

- **Right Click/Drag:** Delete particles within the brush area.

- **Left Click/Drag:** Spawn particles within the brush area.

## Available Particles:

1. **Air:** The default particle representing empty space.
2. **Sand:** Dense granular particles that settle at the bottom.
3. **Water:** Fluid particles that flow and interact with other elements.
4. **Brick:** Solid particles that create obstacles in the simulation.

Experiment with the different particles and observe their unique behaviors. Have fun exploring the dynamics of the Particle Game!
